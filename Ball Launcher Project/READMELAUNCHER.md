# Simple Popsicle Stick Ball Launcher (Inventor Design)

This project features a **basic mechanical launcher** designed using **Autodesk Inventor**, constructed primarily from popsicle sticks and rubber bands The design demonstrates basic principles of projectile motion, elastic energy storage, and CAD modeling.

## Tools Used
- **Autodesk Inventor** (Part and Assembly Modeling)
- **PDF / PNG exports** for preview
- Prototype built with physical materials

## Designs Overview
The launcher uses a tension-based mechanism where a **rubber band stores elastic energy**, and a pivoting **trigger arm releases** a ping pong. Popsicle sticks form the structural frame.
