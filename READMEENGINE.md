# Simple Engine Block Design (Multi-CAD)

This project features a simplified model of an **internal combustion engine block**, created using multiple CAD platforms to demonstrate software versatility and core mechanical design principles.

## Objective
Design and model a basic engine block with essential features such as:
- Cylinder bores
- Crankcase housing
- Mounting holes

> The design is not for production, but rather for showcasing CAD modeling skills across various platforms.

## CAD Tools Used
- **AutoCAD**
- **Inventor**
- **Funsion**
- **AutoCAD Mechanical**
