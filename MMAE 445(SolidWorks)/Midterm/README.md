This project includes the complete design, analysis, documentation, assembly setup, and 
manufacturing programming process for the MMAE 445 Midterm Exam. A major focus of this 
midterm was understanding how design modifications influence strength, manufacturability, and 
overall performance, particularly when comparing Bracket P1 and P2. The assignment required 
the creation of two bracket designs, Bracket P1 (#98461) and Bracket P2 (#98462), using 
SolidWorks for modeling, analysis, drawing creation, and assembly with soft jaws, and 
Mastercam for CNC programming. Both parts were modeled from provided blueprints, analyzed 
using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), detailed in fully annotated 2D drawings, assembled in a 5
axis soft jaw setup, and prepared for machining through toolpath programming. The following 
sections describe the workflow, key decisions, results, and engineering observations.
