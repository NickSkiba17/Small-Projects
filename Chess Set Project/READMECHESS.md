## Chicago Skyline Chess Set

This project features a custom-designed chess set where each piece is modeled after a prominent building or landmark from the Chicago skyline. All models were created using **AutoCAD** and exported in `.dwg` formats.

## Tools Used
- **AutoCAD** (3D Modeling)
- 3D printing 

## Chess Piece Mapping
| Chess Piece | Chicago Landmark |
|-------------|------------------|
| Knight      | Crain Cmmunications Building |
| Rook        | Marina City (Corn Cob Towers) |


> Each piece was scaled and modeled to be visually distinct while maintaining physical balance for potential 3D printing.

Also included is a simple chess board to go along with the pieces
